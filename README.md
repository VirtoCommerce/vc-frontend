# Virto Commerce Frontend

<img src="demo.jpg" width="800" alt="catalog view">

**Virto Commerce Frontend** is a single-page web application (SPA) with a fresh look on eCommerce solutions. This is where common B2B and B2C scenarios are combined with the most bleeding-edge technologies to deliver blazing-fast and fully functional solutions. It implements common business use cases needed for a vast majority of projects we build.

Virto Commerce Frontend is designed to be used as-is within the actual **Virto Commerce Platform**. You can modify it by implementing desired components, pages, and shared logic to correspond with your project goals.

## Technologies used

- **Vue3.** Progressive frontend framework with its key features allows to build fast applications.
- **Typescript.** All components and composables have type definitions, so IDE can help you to build clean and working code.
- **TailwindCSS.** The most popular and growing CSS framework provides a wonderful flexible structure to speed up styling.
- **Husky + ESLint + Prettier.** Autoformat, check and fix your code and prevent ugly code style within the repository.
- **Vite.** It is faster than Webpack. Really FASTER. Use it to develop with HMR benefits and to build for production.
- **GraphQL.** Forget about REST, use flexible GraphQL queries and mutations to safely work with the backend.

## Non-functional key features

- **Development performance.** Really fast development using the most effective solution. Enrol SPA in seconds and start to modify code with [HMR features](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-hmr).
- **Client performance.** We are supposed to reach and hold green metrics provided by Google PageSpeed Insights.
- **[Atomic Design Pattern.](https://virtocommerce.com/atomic-architecture)** The Frontend Application UI is based on Atoms, Molecules and Organisms, combined within Pages and shared Components. This provides a high level of code reusability.
- **Fully responsive.** We made our Frontend Application work on multiple devices from Desktops to Mobile phones, concentrating both on UI and UX.
- **Simple styling and customization.** We use TailwindCSS to provide the easiest and most convenient way of CSS usage. Write as less of code as possible, and reuse existing highly customizable framework features.
- **Fully aligned with Virto Commerce Platform.** The SPA is fully aligned with the [Virto Commerce Platform](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-platform) to provide all common B2B and B2C scenarios.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Install `vc-platform` 3.x the latest version. [Deploy on Windows](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-platform/blob/master/docs/getting-started/deploy-from-precompiled-binaries-windows.md) or [Deploy on Linux](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-platform/blob/master/docs/getting-started/deploy-from-precompiled-binaries-linux.md)
- Install `vc-module-experience-api` module. [Getting started](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-experience-api/blob/dev/docs/getting-started.md)
- Install [vc-module-profile-experience-api](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-profile-experience-api) module.
- Install [vc-module-file-experience-api](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-file-experience-api) module.
- Install [vc-module-push-messages](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-push-messages) module.
- Install [Node.js v20](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (**20.11.0** or later)
- Enable [corepack](https://yarnpkg.com/corepack) *(run as administrator on Windows)*
  ```bash
  corepack enable
  ```
- If you have installed `yarn` globally, uninstall it:
  - via `npm`
    ```bash
    npm uninstall --global yarn
    ```
  - or through your Operation System installation tools
     - `Control Panel`, `Chocolatey` or `Scoop` on *Windows*
     - `Launchpad`, `Finder`, `Homebrew` or `MacPorts` on *macOs*
     - Native package manager such as `apt` on *Linux*

### Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-theme-b2b-vue.git "C:\vc-theme-b2b-vue\"
```

### Check yarn version
```bash
yarn -v
```
`Yarn` should be of version **4.1.0** or greater, not 1.XX.

### Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

### Build

#### Run with hot reload for development

- Add new **.env.local** file
- Copy **APP_BACKEND_URL** from **.env** file and change it's value to the correct endpoint to `Virto Commerce Platform`:

```dotenv
# .env.local file
APP_BACKEND_URL=https://localhost:5001
```

- Run command: `yarn dev` or `yarn dev-expose`
- Follow the link in the terminal

#### Build with validation and minification for production

```bash
yarn build
```

#### Build in development mode

```bash
yarn build:dev
```

#### Build in development mode with change tracking

```bash
yarn build:watch
```

## Types generation

Command:
```
yarn generate:graphql
```
makes two steps:
1. Downloads `schema.json` from GraphQL server located at the `APP_BACKEND_URL`
2. Generates the `types.ts` file separately for general modules and independent modules.

If independent modules are not installed on `The Platform`, types can still be safely generated.

## Dependency Analysis

### Bundle Size Analysis

To examine the sizes of various chunks such as `vendor.js` or `index.js`, execute the following command:
```
yarn generate:bundle-map
```
The results will be located in the `artifacts` folder.

### Visualizing the Dependency Graph

To create a visual representation of the dependency graph, use the following command:
```
yarn generate:dependency-graph
```
**Note**: This command requires parameters to run successfully. For example:
```
yarn generate:dependency-graph client-app/main.ts client-app/shared/account/components/checkout-default-success-modal.vue
```
The generated graph will also be saved in the `artifacts` folder.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error such as `dot command not found` on Windows, ensure that [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) is installed on your system.
