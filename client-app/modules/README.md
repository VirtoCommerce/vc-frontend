# Modules Guide

Welcome to the **Modules Guide**! This documentation will help you understand how to create and manage modules within the project. Modules are the building blocks of our application, promoting scalability and maintainability.

## Modules Architecture

**Why Modules Architecture:**

- **Scalability:** Easily add new features without affecting existing ones.
- **Maintainability:** Isolated codebases make it easier to manage and debug.
- Any **Module** in the `/modules` folder can be safely removed without affecting **Core**
- **Clear Control** by decision-making person.

### Core

The **Core** is the main application that includes the API, router, builder, and other systems.

### [Module](#what-is-a-module)

A **Module** is an additional functionality developed with minimal impact on the **Core**.

### Extension points

**Extension points** are belong to the **Core**. Also called **Holes** or **Sockets**
You can read more about them in the [Extension points](../shared/common/composables/extensionRegistry/README.md) documentation.

### Module Management System

The **Module Management System** is the decision-making point and business logic handler. It is represented as a [settings_data.json](../config/settings_data.json) as a bundle level and an array of `modules` in the `getStore` request as a store level settings. Could be considered as a "Feature Flags".

### [Type Generation System](#what-is-a-type-generation-system)

The **Type Generation System** handles the generation of types and constants for GraphQL API.

## What is a Module?

A **module** is a self-contained feature area within the application. Each module encapsulates its own components, services, APIs, and other related code. Examples include modules for quotes management, user reviews, notifications and back-in-stock subscriptions.

## Folder Structure

Organizing your module with a consistent structure ensures clarity and ease of navigation. Here's the recommended structure for a module:

```
your-module/
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ graphql/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ YourComponent.vue
â”œâ”€â”€ composables/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useYourFeature.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ YourModulePage.vue
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ localization/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ en.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ de.json
â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â””â”€â”€ index.ts
```

- **api/**: Contains all API-related code, including GraphQL schemas and generated types.
- **components/**: Vue components specific to the module.
- **composables/**: Vue composables (hooks) for shared logic within the module.
- **pages/**: Module-specific pages that integrate with the application's routing.
- **localization/**: Localization files for supporting multiple languages.
- **types/**: TypeScript interfaces and types for the module.
- **index.ts**: Entry point exporting public APIs (mainly init function).

## What is a Type Generation System?

Each module typically includes its own GraphQL types, often defined in a `types.ts` file within an `api/graphql` folder. These types **are generated** using the following npm command:

```bash
yarn generate:graphql-types
```

This command triggers the execution of the generator.ts script, which is responsible for generating the types.ts files for both the core application and the independent modules.

The `scripts/graphql-codegen/generator.ts` file also plays a crucial role in handling standalone GraphQL schemas. It includes an array called `independentModules`, where each object represents a separate GraphQL schema that needs to be generated independently.

```typescript
 {
    name: "YourModule",
    apiPath: "client-app/modules/your-module/api/graphql",
    schemaPath: `${process.env.APP_BACKEND_URL}/graphql/your-module`,
  },
```

### Registering Routes

Modules register their routes through an `init` function within the module. This function is called during the application's initialization phase, typically in the `app-runner.ts`.

#### Module Initialization Interface

Each module should export an `init` function that accepts the router and other necessary dependencies (e.g., i18n).

```typescript
// modules/your-module/index.ts
import { Router } from "vue-router";
import { I18n } from "@/i18n";

// Define your components
const YourModulePage = () => import("./pages/YourModulePage.vue");
// By using () => import('./pages/YourModulePage.vue'), you ensure that Vue Router can handle the component as a lazy-loaded route, which is the intended usage pattern.

export async function init(router: Router, i18n: I18n): Promise<void> {
  const route = {
    path: "/your-module",
    name: "YourModule",
    component: YourModulePage,
    beforeEnter(to: any, from: any, next: Function) {
      // Add any route guards or logic here
      next();
    },
  };

  router.addRoute(route);
}
```

---

### Example of Initialization Function Usage

To integrate a module into the main application, you need to import the module's `init` function and call it within the app's runner. Below is an example of how to do this:

```typescript
// client-app/app-runner.ts

// Import the module's init function
import { init as initYourModule } from "@/modules/your-module";

...

initYourModule(router, i18n);

```

## Best Practices

To ensure consistency and high quality across all modules, follow these best practices:

1. **Consistent Structure:**

- Adhere to the recommended folder structure.
- Keep related files grouped together.

2. **Isolate Module Logic:**

- Avoid cross-module dependencies unless necessary.
- Use the module's `composables` for shared logic.

3. **Type Safety:**

- Define clear TypeScript types in the `types/` directory.
- Ensure all API interactions use generated GraphQL types.

4. **Documentation:**

- Document public APIs, components, and composables.
- Keep the `README.md` updated with relevant information.

5. **Naming Conventions:**

- Use clear and descriptive names for files and functions.
- Follow the project's naming guidelines.

6. **Testing:**

- Write unit and integration tests for module functionalities.
- Ensure tests are located alongside the code they test.
