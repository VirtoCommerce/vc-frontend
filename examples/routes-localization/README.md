# Router Localization Examples

This folder shows how to localize your routes. 

For example, you can have a route like `/cart` and you want to localize it to `/carrinho` in Portuguese. 

You can also have a route like `/product/:productId` and you want to localize it to `/produkt/:productId` in German.

These are the cases where this example comes in handy.

- `localization.helpers.ts` - helpers for localization.
- `01-usage.ts` — wrap routes with localized aliases.

These are **reference snippets only**: you can use them as a reference to implement localization of your routes in your project.
