# Router Localization Examples

This folder shows how to use the localization helpers.

- `localization.helpers.ts` - helpers for localization.
- `01-usage.ts` — wrap routes with localized aliases.

These are **reference snippets only**: you can use them as a reference to implement localization of your routes in your project.
