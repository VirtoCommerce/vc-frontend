# Router Localization Examples

This folder shows how to use the localization helpers.

- `localization.helpers.ts` — simplified versions of `withLocalizedAliases` and `resolveLocalizedRedirect`.
- `01-aliases.ts` — wrap routes with localized aliases.
- `02-redirect.ts` — compute a redirect to the localized path.

These are **reference snippets only**: copy-paste into your project or run them with `ts-node` to explore.
